# "docwarrior" concept

"docwarrior" concept following the approach of task/time/bugwarrior and decentralized __Linked Data__ for cross-referencing.

## goals:

broadly, the goal is to ensure that documents are findable, accessible, and interoperable. 

Specifically, it is needed to:

* handle diverse media (confluence, redmine, gitlab(s)/github, overleaf, various wikis)
* facilate inspecting and embeding of metadata, especially that needed for connecting documents: user identities, bidirectional cross-references, domains and topics.
* help with using document conversion (e.g. pandoc)
